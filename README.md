Last Updated: September 7, 2025

## 1. Overview

Check Me ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using Check Me, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Automatically Collected Information
- **Device Information**: Device model, OS version, app version, device identifier
- **Usage Statistics**: App usage frequency, feature usage patterns, interaction data
- **Analysis Results**: Condition scores (0-100), analysis timestamps, mood states (text only - NO facial images are collected or stored)

### 2.2 Optional Information
- **User Preferences**: Theme settings, notification preferences
- **User Profile**: Optional nickname or display name

### 2.3 Camera Data Processing
- **Real-time Processing Only**: Camera feed is processed in real-time for analysis
- **No Storage**: Facial images are NEVER saved to device storage or transmitted to servers
- **Immediate Deletion**: All image data is removed from memory immediately after analysis

## 3. How We Process Information

### 3.1 Processing Purpose
- Providing real-time condition analysis and feedback
- Tracking condition trends over time (using numerical data only)
- Improving app functionality and user experience
- Generating anonymized usage statistics

### 3.2 Processing Method
- **On-Device Processing**: All facial analysis occurs exclusively on your device
- **No Server Transmission**: Facial images and biometric data never leave your device
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processing happens in real-time with immediate data disposal

### 3.3 Face Data Processing Policy

#### Explicit Statement on Face Data Non-Retention
**Check Me does NOT retain any face data.** All facial analysis is performed in real-time on your device, and face data is immediately and completely erased from memory after processing. We do not store, transmit, backup, or retain facial images or biometric face data in any form.

#### Purpose of Face Data Processing
We process face data exclusively for the following purposes:
- **Real-time emotion detection**: To analyze your current emotional state and provide immediate feedback
- **Daily wellness monitoring**: To help you track your emotional patterns throughout the day
- **Personalized insights**: To provide customized wellness recommendations based on your emotional trends
- **Mental health support**: To help you better understand and manage your emotional wellbeing

#### Face Data Storage Duration
- **Raw facial images**: NOT stored at all - processed in real-time and immediately deleted from memory (0 seconds retention)
- **Biometric face data**: NOT stored at all - computed temporarily for analysis and immediately discarded (0 seconds retention)
- **Face templates or models**: NOT created or stored
- **Only numerical results retained**: We only store numerical emotion scores (0-100) and text mood labels, never face data itself

#### Reason for Our Storage Policy
We have designed our app to process face data without retention because:
- **Privacy First**: Your facial data is highly sensitive and we respect your privacy
- **Security**: Not storing face data eliminates any risk of facial data breaches
- **Compliance**: We adhere to the strictest privacy standards and regulations
- **Trust**: We want you to feel confident using our app without privacy concerns

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

### 4.1 Locally Stored Data
- **User Settings**: Stored until app deletion
- **Theme Preferences**: Stored until app deletion
- **App Configuration**: Stored until app deletion

### 4.2 Analysis Results Storage (NOT Face Data)

#### What We Store (Numerical Data Only)
**We explicitly confirm that NO face data is retained.** We only store:
- **Condition scores**: Numerical values (0-100) representing emotional states
- **Timestamps**: Date and time of each analysis session
- **Mood labels**: Text descriptions like "Happy", "Tired", "Focused", "Stressed"
- **Aggregate statistics**: Daily/weekly/monthly averages and trends

#### Why We Store Analysis Results
- **Progress Tracking**: To enable you to monitor your emotional wellbeing over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: To identify trends that may help improve your mental health
- **Historical Insights**: To provide meaningful comparisons and progress reports
- **Personal Growth**: To support your journey toward better emotional awareness

#### Storage Duration and Justification
- **Analysis Results**: Retained for maximum 30 days
- **Why 30 Days**: This period provides sufficient historical context for meaningful trend analysis while minimizing data retention
- **Automatic Deletion**: Data older than 30 days is automatically deleted on a rolling basis
- **User Control**: You can manually delete any or all history at any time through the app settings
- **Complete Removal**: All data is permanently deleted when you uninstall the app
